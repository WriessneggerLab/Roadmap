# Work Roadmap

Technical standards for DL interoperability. This is a temporary repository to organize group work. The long term goal is to open datasets (Physionet/OpenNeuro), so strive for BIDS.
Take a look at [mne-torch](https://github.com/WriessneggerLab/mne-torch).
Please add your experimental data description below:

 Github Handle | N subjects | N trials | Sample frequency | Trial Length | Labels | Description
---------------|------------|----------|------------------|--------------|--------|-------------
 @sophzen | 30 | ~1900/subj/light condition | 500 hz | 1s | Continous Valance/Arousal(1-9) | Visual stimuli: image in VR during 2 different light conditions. Recording with EEG. Regression to valance/arousal scale.
